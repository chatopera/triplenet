Title: TripleNet: Triple Attention Network for Multi-Turn Response Selection in Retrieval-based Chatbots   
Authors: Wentao Ma, Yiming Cui, Nan Shao, Su He, Wei-Nan Zhang, Ting Liu, Shijin Wang, Guoping Hu

## News
We have uploaded our source codes and push the dicts for the model in [google drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wMYiowGHywX43EJebJaj0Pi2oEjbqcKX/view?usp=sharing).

## Notes
For reproducing the performance of TripleNet, please download the datasets of Ubuntu and Douban and push them in the directory 'data', then train or test the model just like the scripts in 'shell'. As we read the data via generator, so please shuffle the traning set before training.
